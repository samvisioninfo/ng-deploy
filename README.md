# corals and other marine aquarium items

# High level description:

The website is to allow people to buy and sell corals and other marine aquarium items with each other. For the MVP, it will only facilitate cash trades and will only operate in Australia.

# MVP Features:

Create accounts, view user page
Create, view, edit and filter listings and communicate between users on listings
Leave reviews
Landing page

# Create accounts, view user page

Users should be able to create an account, likely through google authentication. They should then have a user page that is viewable to anyone on the site. They should be able to add some text to this page (a short bio about themselves) as well as some featured images (some pictures of the fish tanks they keep, or coral etc.) and a profile picture/avatar.

The following information should be stored for each user: First Name, Last Name, email and post code (in Australia this is a four digit number).

The user page should look something like this:

The number after their name at the top is the number of reviews people have left for them. So above, 88 people have left John reviews, with an average of 4.8 stars. It should show what suburb and state the person is in (based on their postcode attached to their account), when they created their account and how many times they have bought and sold a product on the website.

The bottom of the user page should display their current listings and the previous reviews people have left. People should be able to swap between the two options when viewing someone’s user page. If there are no current listings, or no reviews, it should default to the other. The listing index tiles should have a picture of the listing, a title of what the listing is, and any categories it belongs to and the Name of the person who listed it (as above, with Name number of stars, number of reviews).

# Create, view, edit and filter listings

This is a mockup of the page to create and edit listings:

There’s an explanation of the different characteristics here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A1M9feqEUA-idca75fHQral2j8F907keRPCuY-0RbSM/edit?usp=sharing

Note there also needs to be a dropdown option for the type of item to choose between coral, fish/inverts and other.

There should also be the ability to message other accounts to discuss the listing and organise to meet up and buy from eachother. 

# Leave reviews:
Once a sale has been confirmed on both sides. Both people shoudl be able to leave reviews for each other for two weeks after the sale was confirmed. A button to rate out of 5 stars, and also a small text box to insert comments. The reviews shouldn’t be visible until either both reviews have been submitted, or two weeks has passed.

# Landing page

The landing page should show some of the more recent listings at the top, and then beneath that, a few of the categories for people to pick through.
